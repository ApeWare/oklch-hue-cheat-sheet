	- **0–30** = dark
	- **30–70** = mid tones
	- **70–100** = light
2. **C (Chroma = vividness)**
	- **0** = gray, muted
	- **0.1–0.2** = pastel, soft
	- **0.2–0.4+** = saturated, strong
3. **h (Hue angle)**
	- **0° = Red**
	- **90° = Green**
	- **180° = Cyan**
	- **270° = Blue**
	- **360° = Back to Red**
